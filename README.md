# Foxhole-MultiBoxing-Guide

# Why Multibox?
Having multiple accounts in Foxhole can enable you to far more efficiently carry out certain tasks, and simply make life easier. Some examples are below.
* Using alts to drive a train, while you hit switches ahead of it. This makes trains far more enjoyable and safer to drive.
* Setting multiple MPF queues. During low pop hours the MPF can get pretty empty.
* Building. Since building is mostly just endless clicking, set your alts on the job. 
* Emptying autoharvesters. Have an alt sit at the harvester and empty every once in a while, while your main does other stuff.
* Drive multiple vehicles at once - freighters in particular. You can also drive 2 flatbeds pretty easily. Freighters are mostly just holding W, a perfect job for an alt.
* Solo driving tanks. While a bit more contentous than using alts for logi, many people do this, and devs have explicitaly stated it's allowed. No more wrangling a team to tank.

# Is it allowed?
Multiboxing is allowed in Foxhole, so long as your alts are on the same team. Many logi vets have at least one alt, and some have multiple online at the same time. Some have 10+ for MPF queues.

# What you can do with this guide.
If you follow this guide, you will be able to:
* Run as many steam accounts/Foxhole games on the same PC at once as you like.
* Easily switch between windows and organize them anyway youd like.
* See your other Foxhole windows, even on the same monitor. Focus on small regions of other Foxhole windows, for example to track a harvesters inventory, or see just a minimap on an alt.
* Use an autoclicker that allows you to tab out for all accounts - inluding spam click at the chosen location. Includes moving, clicking, etc.
  
# Requirements
* [OpenMultiBoxing](https://openmultiboxing.org/) - for organizing the game windows and switching between them. Also renames the windows, required for the autoclickers to work.
* [SandBoxie-Plus](https://sandboxie-plus.com/) - for running multiple steam accounts/Foxhole games on the same PC.
* [OnTopReplica](https://github.com/LorenzCK/OnTopReplica) - for viewing the other Foxhole windows. This way, all windows can just be stacked on your main monitor.
* [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) - for the autoclickers to work. Either version should work.
* Multiple [steam accounts](https://store.steampowered.com/join) - each with a copy of Foxhole. You can get it on sale for $20.
* Free keys - at least 3-5 per account. An [MMO mouse](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Gaming-Backlit-Programmable-Buttons/dp/B0086UK7IQ) or [Elgato Streamdeck](https://www.elgato.com/us/en/p/stream-deck-xl) are great options. Every action will require its own dedicated key for each account - for example, holding W on account 3 will need a key. While you can use key combinations for this, it can get pretty cumbersome.
* A decent PC and internet connection. You will be able to limit background FPS and lower settings, but there is still a limit. On my 3090 and 5900x, its about 5 accounts.
* Minimal PC skills. This guide will help you, but you need to know your way around a computer, and be able to edit some files.
